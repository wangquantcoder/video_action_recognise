This project is based on the researches about action recognition by dense
trajectories. There are three basic papers written by Heng Wang. 
1.Wang, H., et al. "Action recognition by dense trajectories." IEEE Conference on Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition IEEE, 2011:3169-3176.
2.Wang, Heng, et al. "Dense Trajectories and Motion Boundary Descriptors for Action Recognition." International Journal of Computer Vision 103.1(2013):60-79.
3.Wang, Heng, and C. Schmid. "Action Recognition with Improved Trajectories." IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision 2013:3551-3558.

Before we repeat the work, we should read these paper and understand the process
the authors have done. 
The website http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/wang/dense_trajectories
can provide the details of the work and given the source code.

The future work about this project can be done like this.

Jinhao Tang: 
1.Read these paper and repeat these work by yourself. 
2.Read the source code and add the explanation after code lines.
3.Write the process of implement in Chinese by Microsoft WORD.
4.Pull the source code in the github with https://github.com/wangquantcoder/video_action_recognise
5.Share your work in the group when you come back to school in Sept.
